p3bot
=====

p3bot is the bot that we use at Plugtree's IRC channel. It's developed in
Python so it's really easy to extend. The development process is still ongoing,
but you can freely download it and use it, just beware that there is much place
for improvement on the framework, and you will surely have to refactor your
scripts in the short-term.

Some of the scripts and all the messages are currently written in Spanish.
Internationalization may be added later if someone else starts using it.
